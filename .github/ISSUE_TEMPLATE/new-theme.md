## New theme idea

We would love to support all applications out there, but we need your help to accomplish that. 

Feel free to create a new theme based on our [color palette](https://github.com/getomni/omni#color-palette).

## Add a new theme to the organization

If you have already created a theme, make sure you check the following requirements:

- [ ] The theme follows the [template](https://github.com/getomni/template);
- [ ] The theme follows the Omni Color Palette;
- [ ] The branch name is `main` (we will keep this name pattern from now on);
- [ ] The theme has correct instructions on how to install it;
- [ ] The repository name is lowercase and contains just the application name. E.g. `visual-studio-code`.

**Application:** E.g. Windows Terminal
**Application URL** E.g. https://github.com/microsoft/terminal
**GitHub URL:** E.g. https://github.com/getomni/omni

## Existing Theme

Find the appropriate repository on the [Omni organization](https://github.com/getomni). 
This repository is an umbrella place where we list all themes.
